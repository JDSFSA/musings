Welcome to the site that contains some of the Musings I've managed to document and commit -to e-paper- (I need to use a different word to e-paper but can't quite decide what to use).

After data upload via your visual input device (or oral reciprocators for those with visual impairments) please feel free to purge all or some the recently uploaded musing files from your memory banks.  No offence will be taken as I don't have access to your internal deleted items history.

If there's something that you either like or disagree with, please feel free comment on that post.  But please be constructive, as it will help with development.

If you did find something useful please feel free to like and share.
